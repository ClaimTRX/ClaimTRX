      <div class="news-title">The Biggest CFT Airdrop in History - 300,000 CFT for Buyers!</div>
      <div class="news-date">Posted on February 2, 2025</div>
      <div class="news-content">
        <p>A <span class="highlight">massive reward</span> is coming for CFT supporters! If all 9,000,000 CFT tokens from the official token sale are sold, an incredible <span class="highlight">300,000 CFT</span> will be distributed exclusively to eligible buyers.</p>
        
        <p><b>📅 Eligibility Period:</b> Only purchases made before <span class="highlight">June 11, 2025</span> will count toward the airdrop.</p>
        <p><b>🎁 Airdrop Distribution Date:</b> Once the token sale is complete, but no later than <span class="highlight">December 31, 2025</span>.</p>
        
        <h3>Who is Eligible?</h3>
        <p>To qualify, you must buy at least <b>25,000 CFT</b> directly from the official token sale contract. The following will NOT count toward eligibility:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CFT earned from rewards</li>
          <li>CFT bought on the listing page</li>
          <li>CFT acquired via P2P transactions</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>⚠️ Important:</b> If you sell CFT on the marketplace or swap, the amount sold will be deducted from your eligible buy amount.</p>

        <h3>How the Airdrop Will Be Distributed</h3>
        <div class="airdrop-tier">
          <h4>📌 500,000+ CFT Purchased → 40% of the Airdrop Pool (120,000 CFT)</h4>
          <h4>📌 250,000 – 499,999 CFT Purchased → 30% of the Airdrop Pool (90,000 CFT)</h4>
          <h4>📌 100,000 – 249,999 CFT Purchased → 20% of the Airdrop Pool (60,000 CFT)</h4>
          <h4>📌 25,000 – 99,999 CFT Purchased → 10% of the Airdrop Pool (30,000 CFT)</h4>
        </div>
        
        <p><b>Fairness Adjustment Rule:</b> If a higher tier gets fewer rewards than a lower tier, adjustments will be made to ensure fairness.</p>

        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>This airdrop isn’t just about free tokens – it’s about <span class="highlight">strengthening the CFT ecosystem</span>. By purchasing through the token sale contract, you directly support the growth of the CFT treasury, which is designed to generate ongoing revenue. A robust treasury means a more sustainable ecosystem, higher rewards for stakers, and long-term stability for CFT holders.</p>

        <h3>🚀 Final Countdown to the Airdrop!</h3>
        <p>The clock is ticking! Only purchases made before <b>June 11, 2025</b> count toward the airdrop eligibility. Don’t miss this historic event – secure your CFT from the official token sale contract today!</p>
